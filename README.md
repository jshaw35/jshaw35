- 👋 Hi, I’m @jshaw35 (Jonah)
- 👀 I’m interested in doing science that informs climate policy and mitigation efforts. More specifically, some of my current interests are radiative transfer, polar/high-latitude climate, hyper- and multi-spectral observations, and open-source and reproducible science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dask and Fortran. I am always working to improve my Scientific Writing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work using climate model large ensembles to better understand and quantify climate risk, and interfacing models and observations.
- 📫 How to reach me jonah.shaw@colorado.edu
