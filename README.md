- 👋 Hi, I’m @jshaw35 (Jonah)
- 👀 I’m interested in doing science that informs climate policy and mitigation efforts, radiative transfer, polar/high-latitude climate, hyper- and multi-spectral observations, open-source and reproducible science, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dask, Fortran, and Scientific Writing!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work using climate model large ensembles to better understand and quantify climate risk, and interfacing models and observations, or whatever...
- 📫 How to reach me jonah.shaw@colorado.edu
